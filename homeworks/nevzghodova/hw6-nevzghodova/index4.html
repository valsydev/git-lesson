            <p>The element will scroll along with its container, until it is at the top of the container (or reaches the offset specified in <code>top</code>), and will then stop scrolling, so it stays visible.</p>
            <p>The rest of this text is only supplied to make sure the container overflows, so as to enable you to scroll it and see the effect.</p>

            <p>Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
