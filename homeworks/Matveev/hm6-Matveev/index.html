        <p class="clear">To see the effect of <code>sticky</code> positioning, select the <code>position: sticky</code> option and scroll this container.</p>
        <p>The element will scroll along with its container, until it is at the top of the container (or reaches the offset specified in <code>top</code>), and will then stop scrolling, so it stays visible.</p>
        <p>The rest of this text is only supplied to make sure the container overflows, so as to enable you to scroll it and see the effect.</p>

        <p>Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.</p>
